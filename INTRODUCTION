log4j
------

Java logging package

CVE-2021-44228
severity score of 10.0 

Current Version: log4j version 2.16.0 
(JNDI is fully disabled, support for Message Lookups is removed, and the new DoS vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 is not present)

How to Works?
=============
 the Log4Shell vulnerability normally works by injecting a JNDI LDAP string into your logs, which triggers Log4j to reach out
 to the specified LDAP server looking for more information. In a malicious scenario, the LDAP server can then serve code back
 to the victim machine which will be automatically executed in-memory.
 
 PROBLEM
 =========
 It turns out that Log4j doesn’t just log plain strings. Text strings that are formatted a certain way will be executed
 just like a line from a computer program. The problem is that this allows malicious actors to manipulate computers all
 over the internet into taking actions without the computer owners’ wishes or permission.
 
 Cyberattacks can use this to steal information, force actions, or extort the computer owners or operators.
 
 PRESENT SITUATION:
 ------------------
 The first update — version 2.15.0 — was released on December 6, 2021. As exploitation ramped up in the wild, it became clear
 that the update did not fully remediate the issue in all use cases, a vulnerability that the National Vulnerability Database
 (NVD) codified as CVE-2021-45046.

As a result, on December 13, the Apache Foundation released version 2.16.0, which completely removes support for message
lookup patterns, thus slamming the door on JNDI functionality completely and possibly adding to development team backlogs
to update material sections on their codebase that handle logging.
