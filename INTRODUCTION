Java logging package

CVE-2021-44228
severity score of 10.0 

Current Version: log4j version 2.16.0 
(JNDI is fully disabled, support for Message Lookups is removed, and the new DoS vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 is not present)

How to Works?
=============
 the Log4Shell vulnerability normally works by injecting a JNDI LDAP string into your logs, which triggers Log4j to reach out
 to the specified LDAP server looking for more information. In a malicious scenario, the LDAP server can then serve code back
 to the victim machine which will be automatically executed in-memory.
